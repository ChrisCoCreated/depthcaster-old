# 🎉 New Features Update

Lots of developments this week. It's now doing a pretty good job of filtering out the noise I think. All of this is work in progress. Please feedback what is and isn't working for you, and anything you would like to see.

## 🎯 Quality Scoring & Filtering

AI-powered quality analysis automatically evaluates all casts and replies to help you find the most thoughtful conversations. Filter your feed by minimum quality score (20+, 50+, 60+, 70+) and sort by "highest quality replies" to surface the best content first. Quality scores help you discover valuable discussions and skip low-quality noise.

## 💬 Reply Filtering

Filter replies by quality score to focus on the most valuable conversations. Use focus reply functionality for easier navigation through threaded discussions, and see clearer messaging when no quality replies are available.

## 📁 Category Filtering

Filter curated feeds by topic to find exactly what interests you. Available categories: Crypto Critique, Platform Analysis, Creator Economy, Art & Culture, AI Philosophy, Community & Culture, Life Reflection, Market News, Playful Content, Other. Feedback on these catagories welcome!

## 🔔 Enhanced Notifications

Get notified about activity on casts you've curated, including new replies and reactions. Filter notifications by user quality scores to focus on high-value interactions. Customize what you receive through the notification settings panel, and mute specific users directly from the notification panel (not quite implemented yet). You'll also receive app update notifications when new features are available.

## Other Improvements

- **Compressed View**: Toggle to collapse/expand text in curated feeds to see more content at a glance. Your preference is saved automatically.
- **UI/UX**: Improved responsive design for mobile, better header layout, enhanced curator filtering with visual avatars, collapsible filters, and an improved onboarding flow.
- **Performance**: Faster loads with enhanced caching, more reliable reaction tracking and sync, and more accurate notification counts.
