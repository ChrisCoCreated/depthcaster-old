# Sopha

**A Long from farcaster client focused on deep thoughts, philosophy, art, and meaningful conversations.**

Sopha is a thoughtfully designed social media client built for the Farcaster protocol. Unlike traditional social platforms that prioritize viral content and engagement metrics, Sopha is engineered to surface high-quality, substantive content that encourages genuine dialogue and intellectual exchange.

## Core Philosophy

Sopha believes that the best conversations happen when we slow down, think deeply, and engage with ideas rather than algorithms. The platform combines algorithmic intelligence with human curation to create a feed that values:

- **Substance over virality**: Longer, more thoughtful casts are prioritized
- **Quality over quantity**: User quality scores and engagement depth matter more than raw metrics
- **Conversation over broadcasting**: Threaded discussions and meaningful replies are central to the experience
- **Curation over chaos**: Hybrid filtering combines algorithmic signals with manual curation

## Key Features

### Multiple Feed Types

Sopha offers several distinct feed experiences to match your mood and interests:

- **Curated Feed**: Hand-picked content from high-quality users and channels, with customizable curator selection and multiple sorting options (Recently Curated, Time of Cast, Recent Reply)
- **Trending**: Quality-filtered trending content that surfaces what's resonating across Farcaster
- **For You**: Personalized recommendations based on your interests and interactions
- **Following**: A clean view of casts from users you follow
- **My 37**: A personal feed featuring up to 37 carefully selected users you choose, perfect for creating your own intimate social circle

### Advanced Content Filtering

The platform uses a sophisticated hybrid filtering system that combines:

- **Algorithmic Intelligence**: User quality scores, cast length analysis, and engagement depth metrics
- **Manual Curation**: Curated lists of high-quality users and specialized channels
- **Community Signals**: Reply depth, engagement quality, and conversation threading
- **Customizable Filters**: Hide short casts, trading-related content, dollar casts, and more

### Threaded Conversations

Experience full conversation threads with quality-ranked replies. Every cast can be expanded to reveal the entire discussion, making it easy to follow complex, multi-participant conversations and dive deep into topics that matter to you.

**Unique Feature**: Sopha treats quote casts as first-class conversation participants. When someone quotes a cast, that quote appears as a top-level reply in the original cast's thread, seamlessly integrating quoted commentary into the conversation flow. This innovative approach ensures that all responses—whether direct replies or quotes—are part of the same unified discussion, making it easier to follow the full context of any conversation.

### Curator Packs

Create and share custom collections of users called "Curator Packs." These packs allow you to:

- Build your own curated lists of interesting users
- Share packs publicly or keep them private
- Discover packs created by others
- Filter feeds by specific packs to focus on particular communities or topics

### Real-Time Notifications

Stay connected with a comprehensive notification system that tracks:

- Replies to your casts
- Quotes of your content
- Mentions and interactions
- Follows, likes, and recasts
- Customizable notification preferences

### Progressive Web App

Sopha is a fully functional Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning you can:

- Install it on your device like a native app
- Use it offline with service worker support
- Receive push notifications
- Enjoy a seamless, app-like experience across all devices

### Build Ideas & Feedback System

Sopha includes a unified system for tracking build ideas and user feedback:

- **Build Ideas**: Administrators can create and manage build ideas, feature requests, and development notes directly from the admin panel
- **User Feedback**: Any user can submit feedback, suggestions, or ideas through the feedback icon in the header
- **Cast Linking**: Feedback entries can optionally link to specific casts for context
- **User Attribution**: All entries show who created them, with profile links and avatars
- **Unified Management**: Both build ideas and feedback are managed together in a single interface, distinguished by type badges

The system operates independently from cast tagging, providing a dedicated space for project planning and user input.

### User Customization

The platform offers extensive customization options:

- **Feed Settings**: Control what content appears in your feeds with granular filters
- **Notification Preferences**: Choose which types of notifications you want to receive
- **Curator Selection**: Pick which curators influence your curated feed
- **Sort Options**: Control how content is ordered in different feeds
- **Dark Mode**: Full dark mode support for comfortable viewing in any lighting

### Quality-Focused Design

- **Cast Composer**: Clean, distraction-free interface for writing thoughtful posts
- **Profile Pages**: Comprehensive user profiles showing activity, engagement, and conversation history
- **Image Support**: Rich media support for sharing art, photos, and visual content
- **Link Previews**: Automatic link unfurling for better context and discovery

## Technical Excellence
