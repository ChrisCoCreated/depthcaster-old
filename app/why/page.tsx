          Why Depthcaster Exists

            Farcaster is always evolving. The meta shifts, new experiments appear, and the ecosystem keeps surprising us — and that's part of what makes it exciting. But beneath all of that, there's something deeper that brought many of us here in the first place: the people, the thinking, the generosity, the curiosity, and the quality of conversation about the future we're building together.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Over the past year, that scenius has felt harder to find. The depth is still here, but it's not being surfaced. Social spaces have become faster, louder, more disposable — and the conversations that help us think, imagine, and live well often get lost in the churn.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8 font-semibold">
            Depthcaster exists because those conversations matter.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
            It's for people who care about how we build our digital spaces, how we shape culture, how artists thrive, how communities form, and how we live well in a world defined by technology and creativity. It's for philosophers, nerds, builders, artists, and anyone who wants to think out loud with others who care.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8">
            For a long time, I assumed someone else would build a place for this. Eventually, I realised the person waiting for that to happen was me. I'm an artist and a philosopher-builder at heart, and Depthcaster is the space I wanted to use — so I'm building it with the values that shape my work: depth, wellbeing, playfulness, and experimentation.

            Depthcaster started as me scratching my own itch, but it's growing into a shared contribution to the Farcaster scenius itself.
